## 👋 Welcome!

My name is Andrea, and I'm a data scientist at Accenture with a passion for healthcare. As a data scientist, I help organizations make data-driven decisions developing healthcare costs prdictive models, fraud detection models, and healthcare utlization models. Through my most recent project, I saved an organization millions of dollars by improving the AUC in the models compared to the previous year. 

I have experience in data governance, statistical analysis, machine learning with neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble models.
